### Title:
**[Release] RagNarok's Lobby - System-Agnostic Maintenance Mode Module (Works with ALL Systems!)**

### Post Body:

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to announce the release of **RagNarok's Lobby**, a comprehensive maintenance mode module for Foundry VTT that I've been developing to solve real problems during our actual gameplay sessions.

**What is it?**
RagNarok's Lobby is a full-screen overlay system that lets GMs prevent players from accessing the world during maintenance, session prep, or server updates. When activated, players see a beautiful animated maintenance screen while the GM continues working behind the scenes.

**Key Features:**
✨ **Full-Screen Maintenance Overlay** - Professional, animated UI with smooth transitions
🔒 **Player Access Prevention** - Blocks all interactive elements (no dev console shenanigans!)
⏱️ **Countdown Timers** - Let players know when they can re-enter
🎨 **Fully Customizable** - Custom messages, backgrounds, colors, fonts, and animations
💾 **Appearance Presets** - Save and load your favorite themes
📊 **Chat Monitoring** - Track what your players are saying while they wait
🗳️ **Player Polls** - Quick surveys to keep them engaged
📈 **Analytics** - Track lobby usage and maintenance patterns
🎛️ **One-Click Toggle** - Quick button in the sidebar for easy access
🔄 **Real-Time Sync** - All clients stay synchronized via Foundry's socket system
⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Press ESC to quickly toggle off
🎮 **100% System-Agnostic** - Works with D&D 5e, Pathfinder, PbtA, or ANY system!

**Why I Made This:**
My amazing players have been incredibly patient during maintenance sessions, and I wanted to create something that makes those downtime periods more professional and engaging rather than just seeing a broken world. Plus, I wanted to thank my fiancée Lisa for all her support throughout development.

**Get It:**
- 📥 Download from the [Foundry Module Browser](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ragnaroks-lobby)
- 📖 Full docs available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Odinn-1982/ragnaroks-lobby)
